		"desc": "Yelling ants are represented by the word “AH” contained in <div> tags in the HTML. The JavaScript uses a setInterval loop that runs every 500 milliseconds. Each time that loop runs, a random ant is selected and set to a large font size. Shortly thereafter, the font size is set back to its original tiny size. CSS is mainly used to center and equally space everything with flexbox.",
